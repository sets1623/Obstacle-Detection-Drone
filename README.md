# Obstacle Detection Drone System with Camera Monitoring

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates a software-based prototype of an obstacle detection and alert system for micro drone applications. The system uses an ultrasonic distance sensor simulated in Tinkercad to detect obstacles and provides audio-visual alerts using an LED and a buzzer. A camera-based visual monitoring system is implemented using Python and OpenCV.

## Features
- Obstacle distance detection using ultrasonic sensor
- LED and buzzer alert when obstacle is nearby
- Real-time camera feed for visual monitoring
- Software-based integration using free tools

## Tools & Technologies
- Arduino (Tinkercad Simulation)
- Ultrasonic Sensor
- Python 3
- OpenCV
- GitHub

## Project Structure
- Arduino code for obstacle detection
- Python camera code for visual monitoring
- Screenshots of simulation and integration
- Detailed project report

## How It Works
1. Ultrasonic sensor detects obstacle distance.
2. Arduino logic processes distance data.
3. LED and buzzer activate when obstacle is close.
4. Camera provides real-time visual feedback.
5. Both systems operate simultaneously.

## Future Enhancements
- Real LiDAR integration
- Autonomous obstacle avoidance
- AI-based object detection
